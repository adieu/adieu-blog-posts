Hi, this is Ivan Diao. I'm a web developer based in Shanghai, China and I have been involved in web development since 2007.

Iâ€™m passionate about good open sourced projects and I like building websites using Python and Django as well as hosting them under Linux environment.

I've put most of my open sourced code in `Github <https://github.com/adieu>`_ . More code will be released when I have time to add documents and tests to it.

I have strong interested in understanding how things work and building stuff to solve problems I have. So I spend much of my free time playing with variety stuff like open source projects, electronic gadgets, embed systems etc.
